# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-

Tic Tac Toe is a popular two-player game that can be implemented using JavaScript. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to place three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The JavaScript code for a Tic Tac Toe game usually includes the following elements:

A game board represented as a two-dimensional array
Variables to keep track of the current player (X or O)
Event listeners to detect when a player clicks on a square on the game board
Functions to check for a win or a draw
A game loop to handle the flow of the game
